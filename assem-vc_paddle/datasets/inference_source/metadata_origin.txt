1.wav|Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.|jobs
2.wav|Several recent end to end text to speech models enabling single stage training and parallel sampling have been proposed, but their sample quality does not match that of two stage T T S systems. In this work, we present a parallel end to end T T S method that generates more natural sounding audio than current two stage models. Our method adopts variational inference augmented with normalizing flows and an adversarial training process, which improves the expressive power of generative modeling. We also propose a stochastic duration predictor to synthesize speech with diverse rhythms from input text. With the uncertainty modeling over latent variables and the stochastic duration predictor, our method expresses the natural one to many relationship in which a text input can be spoken in multiple ways with different pitches and rhythms. A subjective human evaluation on the L J Speech, a single speaker dataset, shows that our method outperforms the best publicly available T T S systems and achieves a M O S comparable to ground truth.|TTS_output ## Refered from https://jaywalnut310.github.io/vits-demo/index.html
